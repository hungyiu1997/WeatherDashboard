This is the 3rd week into the program. My favorite part of each assignment is still the ReadMe page, because it is here that my thoughts would make sense and are somewhat accessible. This homework was easier than the rest because of the extra time and extra help I got from my teammates. It is there that you truly see how some people can just click with the materials. Even if I had spent the same amount of time, I would not have aborbed at the same rate as they do. This is when I asked myself if I really have the same ability as others. I guess it is true that comparison is the thief of joy. It is the comparing myself to my teammates that brought me the extra stress and anxiety. I think it is important for me to hold on that little success I have with this assignement and continue to cheer myself on. Then maybe, maybe one day I will also be as good as they are.
